## Title: QR CODE GENERATOR READER
Abstract:

QR Code Generator and Reader, presents a comprehensive web application facilitating the generation and scanning of QR codes. This application encompasses a home page, QR code generator, and QR code reader modules.

Upon accessing the home page, users are presented with intuitive options to either generate or read QR codes. Selection of either option navigates users to the corresponding functionality.

The QR code generator module empowers users to dynamically generate QR codes by inputting data or selecting preferences. Various data types, including website URLs, text, and contact information, can be encoded. Furthermore, the generator incorporates a feature allowing users to download the generated QR code as an image file for offline usage.

In the QR code reader module, users can leverage the device's camera to scan QR codes in real-time. Additionally, users have the ability to select an image from their device's gallery for scanning purposes. Upon successful scanning of a QR code, the application seamlessly extracts the encoded information, typically a website URL, and redirects users to the associated webpage.

This project is implemented using fundamental web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, alongside specialized libraries for QR code generation and scanning. Notably, user authentication is not a prerequisite for utilizing this application, emphasizing a frictionless user experience.

This project stands as a versatile solution catering to diverse user needs, ranging from personal information sharing to corporate marketing endeavors. Its user-centric design and functionality aim to streamline QR code utilization, facilitating seamless interaction with digital content.
