# QR-Code-Generator
## Title: QR CODE GENERATOR
Abstract:
This project presents the development of a QR code generator, a tool that enables users to create QR (Quick Response) codes for different types of content. The generator offers a user-friendly interface where users can input various data types such as URLs, text, contact information, or Wi-Fi credentials. Upon submission, the application processes the input data and generates a QR code image that encapsulates the provided information.
The QR code generator is implemented using modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, for the frontend development. These technologies ensure a responsive and interactive user experience, allowing users to customize the appearance and parameters of the generated QR codes.
Additionally, the backend of the QR code generator is built using a suitable programming language (e.g., Python, Node.js) along with relevant libraries or frameworks for QR code generation. The backend handles the generation of QR code images based on the user input and delivers the generated images to the frontend for display.
Key features of the QR code generator include:
1. Support for various data types, including URLs, text, contact information, and Wi-Fi credentials.
2. Customization options such as QR code size, colour, error correction level, and encoding format.
3. Real-time preview of the generated QR code based on user input adjustments.
4. Ability to download the generated QR code image in different file formats (e.g., PNG, SVG).
5. Compatibility with different devices and screen sizes, ensuring accessibility across desktop and mobile platforms.

Overall, the QR code generator project aims to provide a versatile and user-friendly tool for creating QR codes, catering to diverse use cases ranging from digital marketing to personal information sharing.
